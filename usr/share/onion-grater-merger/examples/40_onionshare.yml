## tested with onionshare v0.9.2-67-g12acb89
## tested with tor 0.2.9.8-2~d80.jessie+1

## Tor's reply ClientAuth
## 250-ClientAuth=onionshare:xxxKEYBLOBxxxxxxxxxxxx
## is left intact because onionshare's button 'Copy HidServAuth' coppies the
## following into the clipboard, which is a usability feature.
## HidServAuth domainxxxxxxxxxx.onion xxxKEYBLOBxxxxxxxxxxxx
## Otherwise the user would have to extract it from onion-grater
## logs.

## Tor's reply PrivateKey gets redacted.

## HS_DESC CREATED, UPLOAD, UPLOADED, HiddenService descriptors content and
## HsDir gets redacted.
